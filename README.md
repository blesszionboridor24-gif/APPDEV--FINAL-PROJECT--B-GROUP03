Project Title
Student Task & Note Manager App

Project Overview
This project is a lightweight, full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed specifically for students. It serves as a central productivity hub where users can manage their academic responsibilities, brainstorm ideas via notes, and track deadlines through a reminder system. The app focuses on simplicity and efficient data organization.

Objectives
Centralize Organization: Provide a single platform for both long-form notes and short-term "To-Do" tasks.
Task Accountability: Enable users to track progress by marking reminders as completed.
Efficient Retrieval: Implement a filtering system to help students quickly toggle between school-related tasks and personal notes.
Asynchronous Data Handling: Practice modern web development by connecting a frontend interface to a backend server using the Fetch API.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Backend: Node.js and Express.js framework
Database: MongoDB or JSON file-based storage
API Integration: Fetch API (used for seamless communication between the Frontend and Backend)
Optional Integration: Local Browser Notification API

Key Features
Note Management: Full CRUD functionality to add, edit, and delete text-based notes.
Reminder System: A task list where items can be toggled as "Done" or "Pending."
Category Filtering: Organizational tags (e.g., School, Personal) to sort and view specific content.
Emerging Tech Integration: Real-time data fetching from the backend and optional local notifications for time-sensitive reminders.
